# An Analysis of stock using VBA and Excel
The purpose of this analysis is to help determine which stocks would be a good investment. Steve is concerned that his parents invested in only one stock because of the name. He created a spreadsheet with all of the stock information and asked for help analyzing the stock data. We created buttons for Steve to be able to look at the outcomes for 2017 and 2018. In order for this code to be more efficient, we refactored it to take fewer steps, use less memory and improve the logic to make it easier to read. 

### Results
Using the initial code, we were able to see that the DQ stocks are not a good investment for Steve's parents.After refactoring, we verified the results of refactored code are the same as the initial code. We captured the run-time of the analysis for 2017 and 2018 using the refactored code and included the PNG in the resource file.
